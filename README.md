####Overview

*These scripts are a work in progress*. 

The goal is to have an implementation of SUSTAIN (Love, Medin, & Gureckis, 2004) for application in  traditional artificial classification learning (TACL) experiments. Keeping things as simple as possible, I'm not implementing the feature prediction aspects of the model -- this implementation will be used exclusively for class prediction.


####To-Do List

1. Make the forward pass script more efficient.
2. Make sure there aren't any errors in the convert to continuous dimensions.
3. Write a better README!
4. Write better comments/documentation.
